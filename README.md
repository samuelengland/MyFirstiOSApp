# MyFirstiOSApp

***Yin Yang***

This was my first iOS App developed in early 2015. The idea of this app was to see what I could create using iOS, starting with SpriteKit.
The game is a sidescroller, where you are either in yin form or yang form. While your outer rim is black, you can only touch white surfaces, and vice versa.
The game progressively gets harder and faster and also saves your scores to file.
